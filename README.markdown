this application targets making a circulation between my ideas ,  my tasks , and translating it to a web-application which will be handy to others.

completed-tasks:
-------
- model name: Compare
  - reading a multi-lingual book: 
  - you will be able to read a book and its translation - it will organize the text, splitted to sentences, in a comfortable table.

- model name: Smart(where u can get smarter :)
  - the application trying to become self-aware: 
  - you r able to write new Ruby code, the app will evaluate the entered string as a Ruby expression,
  - so u can keep exploring the rails framework:
    - i hope it  will become a game eventualy, where users will have to hack each other's profile.
